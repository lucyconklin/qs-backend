    <h1>Quantified Self Backend API</h1>

    <p>This API handles Create Read Update and Delete for a foods table where each
      food has a name and calorie amount. You can fetch all foods stored in the
      database, see one food, add a new food, edit an existing food, or delete a
      food.</p>
    <p>Designed to work with my
      <a href='https://github.com/Laszlo-JFLMTCO/QS_Starter_Kit'>
        Quantified Self
      </a>
      front end, this API is fully independent and sits on a postgres database.</p>

    <h2>Endpoints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>`GET` to `/api/all-foods/` returns a list of all foods as JSON</li>
      <li>`GET` to `/api/all-foods/:id` returns a single food record with that id as JSON</li>
      <li>`POST` to `/api/all-foods` will add a food to the database. See examples below for details on which attributes to include in the body of the request</li>
      <li>`PUT` to `/api/all-foods/:id` will edit a food. See examples below for details on which attributes to include in the body of the request</li>
      <li>`DELETE` to `/api/all-foods/:id` will delete the food record with that id.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>URL Params</h2>
    <p>Pass the id (if required) in through the url. Pass all other information in the body of your request.</p>

    <h2>Success response</h2>
    <p>For `GET` and `PUT` requests to an :id and all `POST` requests, the success response will be the requested or new record.</p>
    <p>For `DELETE` requests you should see a message indicating that you have successfully deleted a record.</p>

    <h2>Error response</h2>
    <p>Most endpoints will have helpful error messages. Usually this will occur when require params have not been included in the request.</p>

    <h2>Sample Calls</h2>

    <h4>Visit from your browser:</h4>
    <p><a href='/api/all-foods'>/api/all-foods</a>
    <p><a href='/api/all-foods/1'>/api/all-foods/1</a>

    <h4>From your app:</h4>
    <pre>
      $.ajax({
          url: API + '/api/all-foods',
          method: 'GET'
        })
    </pre>

    <h2>Current Progress</h2>
    <p>This is the first pass at CRUDing the entire API. Going further I would like to pull out the functions into an MVC pattern.</p>

    <p>Next I would like to call this site from my Quantified Self front end.</p>
